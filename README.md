What is CSS? Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

You can get CSS styles from a few different sources: External Style Sheets, styles that are defined in the header, & styles that are defined inline.
The browers will take the inline styles over the other 2. Depending on if you define the style in header before you reference the external style sheet will determine which takes precendent.

Anatomy of a CSS ruleset:
`p {
color: red;
}`

p = Selector

color = property

red = property value

color: red = declaration
